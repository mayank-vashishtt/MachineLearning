What is Boosting?
Imagine you have a group of friends, and each friend is not very good at guessing answers to questions. 
But if you combine their guesses smartly (like focusing on the friends who got some answers right), 
the group can collectively give better answers. That’s the basic idea of boosting—combining weak models to make a strong one.

-----------------------------------------------

What is AdaBoost?

AdaBoost stands for Adaptive Boosting. It’s a specific type of boosting algorithm that works by:

Training a weak model (like a small decision tree).
Checking what it gets wrong.
Training another model that focuses on fixing those mistakes.
Repeating this process several times and combining all the models to get a final, strong prediction.

Key Terms

Weak Learner: A simple model, like a decision stump (a small decision tree with just one split).
Weights: Numbers that tell the algorithm how important each data point is. 
Harder data points (those that were misclassified) are given more weight.

-----------------------------------------------

Steps in AdaBoost

Start with Equal Weights: Give equal importance to all data points.
Train a Weak Model: Train a simple model on the data.
Update Weights: Increase the weights of the data points the model got wrong so the next model focuses on them.
Repeat: Train another weak model and update weights again.
Combine Models: Combine all the weak models into one strong model.

Visualization of Boosting
Imagine you’re building a tower:

Start with a weak foundation (weak learner).
Add layers, improving stability each time (correcting errors).
The final tower is strong because it combines all layers effectively.

Why Use AdaBoost?

It’s easy to implement.
It works well on small datasets.
It improves accuracy by focusing on hard-to-classify instances.
