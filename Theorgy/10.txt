1.What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is like asking your friends (neighbors) for advice. When you don’t know what to do, 
you ask a few people around you (the closest ones) and go with the majority opinion. In KNN:

Data points are like "friends."
Distance tells you who is closer.
The majority vote decides the outcome (classification).

-----------------------------------------------

2. How Does KNN Work?

Imagine This:

You want to know if a fruit is an apple or an orange.

You have a list of fruits you’ve seen before with their weight and color.
For a new fruit, you check how close it is to other fruits you know.
If most nearby fruits are apples, this new fruit is probably an apple!

-----------------------------------------------

3. Steps of KNN

Data Preparation: Organize your data into two parts:

Features (the characteristics, like weight, color).
Labels (the answer, like "apple" or "orange").

Calculate Distance: Measure how far this new fruit is from all other fruits (we’ll use the Euclidean distance formula).

Find Neighbors: Pick the closest fruits (neighbors) based on the distance.

Vote: See which label (apple or orange) has the majority.

Predict: Assign the majority label to your new fruit.

-----------------------------------------------

4. What is Euclidean Distance?

Euclidean distance is like drawing a straight line between two points to see how far apart they are.
Distance= root((x2​−x1​)^2+(y2​−y1​)^2​)
