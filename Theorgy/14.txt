Introduction to Boosting Techniques
Boosting is a machine learning technique used to improve the performance of weak models (models that don't perform well on their own) 
by combining them into a strong model. In other words, boosting focuses on improving the accuracy of a model by training multiple models 
sequentially, where each new model tries to correct the mistakes made by the previous ones.

-----------------------------------------------

What is Boosting?
Boosting involves combining the predictions of multiple models (called learners) to create a final prediction 
that is more accurate than any individual learner. 
These learners typically have a higher bias (not very accurate on their own) but low variance (they don't change much with different data). 
When combined, they perform better than individually.

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)
AdaBoost is one of the most popular boosting techniques. Here's how it works:

How AdaBoost Works
Base Learners: AdaBoost typically uses decision stumps (very simple trees with just one split or decision point) as its base learners. 
These are weak models that don't perform very well on their own.

Weighting Misclassified Data: AdaBoost works by giving more importance (weight) to the data points 
that the current model misclassifies. This makes the next model focus on these difficult cases.

Final Prediction: After training multiple models, AdaBoost combines their predictions by giving them 
different weights based on how well each model performed. The final prediction is a weighted vote of all the models.

-----------------------------------------------

Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is another popular boosting technique, but it works a bit differently:

How Gradient Boosting Works

Initial Prediction: First, it starts with an initial guess of the prediction (like the average of all the target values). 
This is called the initial prediction.

Calculating Residuals: Gradient Boosting calculates the residuals or errors 
(the difference between the true value and the predicted value) from the previous model. 
Instead of re-weighting the data like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting focuses on predicting these residuals.

Correcting Residuals: New models (trees) are created to predict the residuals. 
These models try to correct the errors made by the previous ones.

Final Prediction: The final prediction is made by adding the contributions of all the models, 
typically adjusting for the learning rate (how much each new model should influence the final result).

-----------------------------------------------

Gradient Boosting Example:
Suppose the first model guesses the target value for each data point.
The second model focuses on the errors made by the first model.
The third model focuses on the errors of the second model, and so on.
The final prediction combines all these models.

-----------------------------------------------

Key Differences Between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting

Method:
AdaBoost adjusts the weights of the data based on misclassifications.
Gradient Boosting focuses on predicting residuals (errors) made by previous models.

Application:
AdaBoost is mostly used for classification tasks (like predicting categories).
Gradient Boosting is used for both classification and regression tasks (like predicting continuous values).

Focus on Errors:
AdaBoost adjusts the weights of misclassified points.
Gradient Boosting tries to predict the residuals (errors) directly.

-----------------------------------------------

Summary:
Boosting techniques combine weak models to create a strong one.
AdaBoost adjusts weights for misclassified data and combines the predictions of base learners.
Gradient Boosting focuses on predicting residuals (errors) and iteratively improves predictions.
In Python, sklearn provides a simple way to implement Gradient Boosting through GradientBoostingRegressor for regression tasks.
