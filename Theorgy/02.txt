What is Data Aggregation?

Data aggregation means combining or summarizing data to make it easier to analyze. 
In machine learning or business, you often need to summarize data in ways that algorithms or humans can better understand. 
For example, instead of looking at every point where a delivery happens, you might want to know the total time or average speed for a trip.

1. Group By Operations

A Group By operation is like organizing your data into different groups based on some rule. 
For example, if you have a list of students and their marks, you might group them by their class to see how each class is doing.

2. Cumulative Sum and Aggregation

Cumulative Sum: This means adding up the numbers as you go along. 
For example, if you want to know the total time spent on a trip, you add the times from each stage of the trip together.

Aggregation Techniques: When youâ€™re grouping data, you can decide how to summarize each group. Sometimes, you use:

Sum: Add things together (e.g., total time for all segments of a trip).
Last: If something accumulates over time (e.g., the final time of a trip, including all delays and pauses), you just pick the last value.
