What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes, like:
Spam (1) or Not Spam (0)
Fraud (1) or Not Fraud (0)


It works by predicting a probability value between 0 and 1. For instance:

If the probability is above a certain threshold (default is 0.5), the model classifies it as 1.
Otherwise, it classifies it as 0.

-----------------------------------------------

How Logistic Regression Works:

It uses the sigmoid function to calculate probabilities. The sigmoid function formula is:

Formula:
σ(x) = 1/(1+e^(-x))

Here,
z = wx + b  (a linear combination of weights and inputs) 
w are weights, 
x is the input, and 
b is the bias.

3. Why We Need Evaluation Metrics
We need to check how well the model performs by using evaluation metrics like:

Confusion Matrix
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Accuracy

-----------------------------------------------

Evaluation Metrics

a) Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a 2x2 table for binary classification that shows:
True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted positive class.
True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted negative class.
False Positive (FP): Predicted positive, but actually negative.
False Negative (FN): Predicted negative, but actually positive.

b) Precision

Precision focuses on the quality of positive predictions:

Precision= TP/(TP + FP)

If precision is high, the model avoids predicting positives incorrectly.


c) Recall (Sensitivity)

Recall measures how well the model identifies actual positives:

Precision= TP/(TP + FN)

High recall means the model is good at capturing all the actual positives.

d) F1 Score
The F1 score balances precision and recall. It’s the harmonic mean of the two:

F1=2×(Precision×Recall/Precision+Recall)

F1 is crucial when the dataset is imbalanced (e.g., one class is much larger than the other).



e) Accuracy
Accuracy is the percentage of correctly predicted instances:

Accuracy=  TP + TN / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
It’s simple but unreliable for imbalanced datasets.
